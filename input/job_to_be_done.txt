Goal: Implement a robust machine learning pipeline for real-time fraud detection in financial transactions.

Specific Tasks:
- Research state-of-the-art fraud detection algorithms
- Understand data preprocessing requirements for transaction data
- Learn about real-time model serving architectures
- Identify performance optimization techniques
- Study feature engineering approaches for financial data
- Understand model monitoring and drift detection

Success Criteria:
- Build a system that can process 10,000+ transactions per second
- Achieve detection accuracy above 95%
- Minimize false positive rates below 2%
- Ensure system can handle concept drift
- Meet regulatory compliance requirements

Context: Our current rule-based system is producing too many false positives and missing sophisticated fraud patterns. We need to upgrade to a machine learning approach that can adapt to new fraud techniques while maintaining high performance and explainability for regulatory requirements.

Urgency: High priority - need to implement within 3 months due to rising fraud losses.
